An online image editor
<br>
Where it is at right now:
<br>
I worked on this project for two months (april - may 2021).
When I began I was naive to the design complexities of image editors.

My design process was this;

I designed a system. Then, I scrapped it and designed and new one. Then, I scrapped that system and redid the whole thing. 

I spent a week getting the basics done and 1.5 months dealing with the complexities.
It started off simple, but I realized that the more code you add, the more code you have to change to accomodate for the code you added...

Flood fill algorithms, text rendering, undo and redo stacks, global variables (bad idea), and many more just made working on this project harder.

So right now it is an old project that I stopped working on because it got too complicated.

There are a lot of bugs when it comes to specific and niche things, but in general it works for its overall purpose.

So while its not the best I can make, its the best I can reasonably make.

Some features I wanted to add include: rotation, grouping, horizontal and vertical flipping, exports and imports from custom .gator files, zooming in and out on the canvas, bezier curves, polygons, importing from svgs, and more.

So what have I learned?

There's a reason Photoshop has no major competitors (GIMP maybe). That reason is that desgining an image editor is not an easy process.
